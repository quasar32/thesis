\noindent\textbf{Contributors} % Required Subheading - Do Not Modify

\indent\indent I would like to thank my faculty advisor, Dr. Shinjiro Sueda,
for his guidance, knowledge, and support throughout the course of this research.

\indent\indent Thanks also to the TAMU Engineering Helpdesk for providing a remote Linux machine and installing requested packages on said machine. All benchmarks were made on this machine.

\indent\indent Two software libraries are statically linked to the simulation code.
The first library, CGLM, short for C OpenGL Mathematics, developed by Recep Aslantas, is used for both the simulation and graphical code. 
The second library, GLAD, developed by David Herberth, is used by the graphical code to load OpenGL. All code not developed by me is clearly marked with the appropriate license.

\indent\indent All other work conducted for the thesis was 
completed by the student independently.
