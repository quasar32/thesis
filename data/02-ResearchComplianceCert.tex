\indent\indent Research activities involving the use of human subjects, vertebrate animals, and/or biohazards must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate Texas A\&M  University regulatory research committee (i.e., IRB, IACUC, IBC) before the activity can commence. This requirement applies to activities conducted at Texas A\&M and to activities conducted at non-Texas A\&M facilities or institutions. In both cases, students are responsible for working with the relevant Texas A\&M research compliance program to ensure and document that all Texas A\&M compliance obligations are met before the study begins. % use A\&M instead of A$\&$M, not use $A\&M$ as well, the last one won't be bold.
